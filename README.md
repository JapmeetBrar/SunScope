# About SunScope 🌞

## Inspiration 💡
We were inspired by the **urgent need for sustainable living solutions**. SunScope was born out of a vision to make **renewable energy accessible** and manageable for homeowners, contributing to a **greener planet**.

## What it does 🏠
SunScope is a **solar panel analysis tool** that calculates the **solar potential** of homes, providing users with data on **expected energy output, cost savings, and environmental impact**, making the switch to **solar power** as transparent and beneficial as possible.

## How we built it 🛠️
We crafted SunScope's **intuitive frontend** using **React** and **Vite with TypeScript**, leveraging their robust ecosystems to create a responsive and dynamic user experience. For the backend, we implemented **Flask** to handle **data processing and API management**, ensuring seamless, efficient server-side operations.

## Challenges we ran into 😵
Integrating **real-time solar data** and **weather APIs** presented significant challenges, as did ensuring **cross-browser compatibility**. Optimizing the app for **performance and scalability** was also a complex task due to the heavy data processing required.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🎉
We're proud of developing a fully functional prototype that **accurately assesses solar potential**. The **responsive design** and **seamless integration** of complex APIs stand as testaments to our team's dedication and technical abilities.

## What we learned 📚
Throughout this journey, we've gained deeper insights into **renewable energy management** and the intricacies of **building a full-stack application**. We've also enhanced our skills in **React, TypeScript, and Flask**, and learned to better integrate **frontend and backend technologies**.

## What's next for SunScope 🔮
Moving forward, we plan to incorporate **machine learning algorithms** to predict solar output more accurately and **expand our database** to cover global locations. We're also exploring **partnerships with solar panel providers** to offer users end-to-end solutions.
